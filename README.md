# MOCGenerator
This repository contains code generates multiple pressure traces for a pipeline with a leak using the Method Of Characteristics

This code was used to generate one of the datasets (for leak location) used in this reference: https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29WR.1943-5452.0001187

README file inside 02_Leak Code folder explains how to run the MATLAB code. This code should generate a 411MB file.

See: Subdatset.csv file contains 3000 (of the 50000) traces used to train the ANN trained to detect leaks.
